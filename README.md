# TaxabilityDeterminer
 "TaxabilityDeterminer" is a Python script that determines whether an inhabitant is taxable based on their age and gender. It prompts the user to input the inhabitant's age and gender (M for male, F for female) and then assesses their taxability based on specific criteria. If the inhabitant is a male over 20 years old or a female between 18 and 35 years old, they are considered taxable; otherwise, they are not taxable. This script helps determine tax eligibility for different individuals.
